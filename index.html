      <h3>Doctor Duties & Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
Assess symptoms
Diagnose conditions
Prescribe and administer treatment
Provide follow-up care of patients, refer them to other providers, and interpret their laboratory results
Collaborate with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and other health professionals
Prescribe medication
Stay current on medical technology and research
Since doctors are responsible for their patients' well-being, this occupation is more demanding than most. In addition to having a comprehensive knowledge of medicine, they need to be able to communicate their findings to patients who typically do not possess the same knowledge. They work with people when they are at their most vulnerable and this requires empathy in addition to the required technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Beyond the foundational duties and responsibilities of all doctors, each specialty in the field requires doctors to be able to perform tasks specific to those jobs. Surgeons, for example, must have the manual dexterity to perform precise operations and the stamina to spend hours at a time in the operating room.</p>

      <h3>Patient</h3>
      <p><b>Checking vital signs:</b> Most activities are scheduled during the day so a patient can rest at night. Checking vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse and respiratory rate) is an exception. From admission to discharge, most patients have their vital signs checked regularly round-the-clock.</p>
<p><b>Lab technicians: </b>Lab technicians will take blood samples very early. This is because the first question on a health care provider’s mind is what were the vitals and the labs today? The team uses the vital signs and lab results from the blood sample to make or adjust their plans for a patient.</p><p>
<b>Meals:</b> Mealtime is a popular time for patients and their friends and family. You can order a guest meal and eat with your family member or friend. Meal times are staggered but usually occur around the expected times—morning, afternoon and evening. Contact your patient’s unit nurse to get a more precise time of when your friend or family member will be served.</p><p>
<b>Personal care: </b>Sometime during the first half of the day personal care assistance will be provided for those who need it. This includes assistance with activities such as brushing teeth and hair, face washing, showering and using the bathroom.</p><p>
<b>Medications:</b> Nurses administer medications to each patient based on the schedule prescribed by the doctor. This schedule doesn’t necessarily correspond to any other activities.</p><p>
<b>Housekeeping:</b> Housekeeping will come into a patient’s room once or twice a day to empty garbage, clean the bathrooms, wipe down sinks and generally keep everything sparkling and orderly. They have to follow many rules to ensure everything is cleaned according to strict standards.</p>

      <h3>Managment</h3>        
      <p>Hospital information systems provide a common source of information about a patient's health history. The system has to keep data in a secure place and controls who can reach the data in certain circumstances. These systems enhance the ability of health care professionals to coordinate care by providing a patient's health information and visit history at the place and time that it is needed. Patient's laboratory test information also includes visual results such as X-ray, which may be reachable by professionals. HIS provide internal and external communication among health care providers. Portable devices such as smartphones and tablet computers may be used at the bedside.

Hospital information systems are often composed of one or several software components with specialty-specific extensions, as well as of a large variety of sub-systems in medical specialties from a multi-vendor market. Specialized implementations name for example laboratory information system (LIS), Policy and Procedure Management System,[1] radiology information system (RIS) or picture archiving and communication system (PACS).

Potential benefits of hospital information systems include:

Efficient and accurate administration of finance, diet of patient, engineering, and distribution of medical aid. It helps to view a broad picture of hospital growth
Improved monitoring of drug usage, and study of effectiveness. This leads to the reduction of adverse drug interactions while promoting more appropriate pharmaceutical utilization.
Enhances information integrity, reduces transcription errors, and reduces duplication of information entries.[2]
Hospital software is easy to use and eliminates error caused by handwriting. New technology computer systems give perfect performance to pull up information from server or cloud servers.</p>
